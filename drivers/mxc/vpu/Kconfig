	  tristate "Support for MXC VPU(Video Processing Unit)"
	  depends on (ARCH_MX3 || ARCH_MX27 || ARCH_MX37 || ARCH_MX5)
	  default y
	---help---
	  The VPU codec device provides codec function for H.264/MPEG4/H.263,
	  as well as MPEG2/VC-1/DivX on some platforms.

config MXC_VPU_IRAM
	bool "Use IRAM as temporary buffer for VPU to enhance performace"
	depends on (MODULE_CCXMX5X)
	default y
	help
	  The VPU can use internal RAM as temporary buffer to save external
	  memory bandwith, thus to enhance video performance.

config MXC_VPU_IRAM_SIZE
	int "IRAM size in bytes to use for the VPU."
	range 0 102400
	default 102400
	depends on (MXC_VPU_IRAM)
	help
	  Set the size of the IRAM used by the VPU as a temporary buffer to save
	  external memory bandwith and enhance video performance.
	  It should be determined by the video codec that uses the largest IRAM.
	  Typically this is VC-1AP for 1080p decoding (101760) and h.263-P3 for
	  720p encoding.

config MXC_VPU_DEBUG
	bool "MXC VPU debugging"
	depends on MXC_VPU != n
	help
	  This is an option for the developers; most people should
	  say N here.  This enables MXC VPU driver debugging.
